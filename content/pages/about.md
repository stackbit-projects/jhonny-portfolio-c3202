My passion is making ideas come to life, be it working solo, as part of a team or leading a team of fellow developers.

Throughout my 5 years of development experience, I worked everywhere from startups to big companies, building products from the ground up or implementing new features.

Also relevant to my set of skills is that - previously to becoming a developer - I worked as product manager for some of the biggest tech companies in the world, which still helps me to have a more holistic view of the whole work that goes into making a successful product.

My go-to technologies are React and Node.js, and I have completed a wide range of projects using them. Those are not the only two libraries/frameworks I'm familiar with though, and I'm always happy to discuss my client's needs and find the best solutions for them.

I consider myself creative and hardworking, as my stats show. If you liked my profile so far, drop me a message and we'll discuss how I can be useful to your project.
