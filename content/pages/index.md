          Fast and thorough, sharp as a tack. Was able to understand the vague
          requirements and complete objectives on time as discussed.

          Great experience working with Jhonny. He successfully completed the
          task on deadline and with all functionality needed. I will work with
          him again. He also communicated very clearly.
